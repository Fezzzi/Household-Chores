# Modules
This page will contain information about brainstormed modules functionality, at the moment, only random cummulation of ideas will be stred here:

- Modules might be separated into own repository, e.g. `Household-modules`. This will require Household App to provide and uphold thoroughly documented API for
communation with these modules. This repository will be **public** and open-source, users will be able to submit custom modules for the application via PRs. Household App will then
have to integrate this external resource and process of App's releasing upon new module/fix in this repository will have to be denoted.
