# API
API is thoroughly described via [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification. There should be
plugins available for a majority of IDEs that allow a dynamic preview of specification [file](./ApiSpecs.json).
There is also a possibility to browse generated `.html` preview [here](./api/api.html), thought it is not guaranteed that
this file holds preview for the latest API configuration.

**Each change in the API of the application is to be properly documented within the
specification file!** `api.html` file should be regularly updated with `html` code generated
from IDE plugins.
